I am sitting still
I think of Angeline
Her mother's voice over me
And the bullets and the war
Where it fell silent
&nbsp;
And on a thousandth hill [?]
I think of Albertine
There in her eyes
What i don't see
with my eye oh
&nbsp;
Rwanda
Now that I have seen
I am responsible
Faith without deeds is dead
Now that I have held you
In my own arms
I cannot let go till you are...
&nbsp;
And I am on a plane
Across a distant sea
But I carry you in me
In the dust on... the dust on... the dust on... the dust on.... ???
My feet
&nbsp;
Rwanda
Now that I have seen
I am responsible
Faith without deeds is dead
Now that I have held you
In my own arms
I cannot let go till you are...
&nbsp;
I will tell the world
I will tell them where I've been
I will keep my word
I will tell them, Albertine
&nbsp;
Rwanda
Now that I have seen
I am responsible
Faith without deeds is dead
Now that I have held you
In my own arms
I cannot let go till you are...
&nbsp;
And I am on a stage
A thousand eyes on me
I will tell them, Albertine
I will tell them, Albertine
